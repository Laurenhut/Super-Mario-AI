Deliverables
 - portfolio page post that makes you look smart
    - detailed github repo 
        - how to run,  what it should do, etc
 - need a detailed description and a link to the linkedin page 
 - cool video/ picture 
 - a 5-6 sentance description that sums it up and makes it interesting
    - relate it as a microcosum of the real world 
       - self drivivng cars 
       - google homes 
       -etc

Discount the epsilon and decrease randomization over time
Train
Cleanup code



use a smaller neural net with just the data instead of using the CNN -DONE
    - input marios position data -DONE
    - input the enemy positions -DONE
    - input the coin positions? -DONE
    - input hole positions -DONE
    - input score -DONE
    - input if mario is on the ground -DONE
    - input collision data? -DONE
    - input if dead/ at end-DONE
    - collisions with stuff-DONE
    
 
increase the number of skipped frames to make this run faster -DONE


added code so that we can end an episode if reach goal/ die  -DONE
added skipframes  - DONE

find way to collect data w/o cv -DONE  (Speedrunners Lua script)
    - mario position -DONE (Highlighted with ###)
    - enemy positions      (May have found it)
    - add if there isenemy or not to CNN
    
fully download Zeromq- DONE (using lua 5.1)
connect lua script to python via zeromq - DONE using (lua 5.1)

rewrite rewards -DONE
    - Reward for killing shit (+1) -DONE
    - reward for reachign end (+100)-DONE
    - neg rward for dying  (-100)-DONE
    - negative reward for going left (-1)-DONE
    
    
increase training speed       (skipfraes should speed it up. Max speed known is x2.5-6 norm) -DONE
    - Dont think i can. Will cause a desync with the lua script. It will start skipping a frame -UNTRUE
        - got rid of the frame by frame control, only inputs data at the secected timestamp

train   (can already train need to retrain with new changes)
    - add script to load old training data -DONE
